********** MODEL NAME
model_2cpt_linear_iv_Ke

********** MODEL NOTES

PK model for simulation of drug concentration in central compartment
with following characteristics:
Compartments:  2
Elimination :  linear
Absorption  :  none (infusion/iv)

Unit convention
Dose: mg
Concentration: ug/mL
Time: hours

The annotation of the parameter units is consistent with the given unit convention.
Units of the inputs (dose) and outputs (concentration) in the dataset for parameter estimation need to match the unit convention.

********** MODEL STATES

d/dt(Ac) 	=  - Kcp*Ac + Kpc*Ap1 - Ke*Ac + INPUT1
d/dt(Ap1) =    Kcp*Ac - Kpc*Ap1

Ac(0)    	= 0
Ap1(0)    	= 0

********** MODEL PARAMETERS

Vc 			  = 10 	# Central volume (L)
Ke 			  = 1 	# -alpha
Kpc			  = 0.05 	# - beta
Kcp			  = 0.05 	# 

********** MODEL VARIABLES

% Calculation of concentration in central compartment
Cc 			  = Ac/Vc

% Defining an output (only needed when interfacing with NLME
% parameter estimation tools such as NONMEM and MONOLIX)
OUTPUT1  	  = Cc  # Compound concentration (ug/mL)
