\title{PKPD G-CSF model of Scholz et al. TBMM 2012, without pegfilgrastim or chemotoxicities}
\usage{
scholz12(Time, State, Pars)
}
\arguments{
\item{Time}{The parameters of this model do not depend on time: this argument
exists here as a dummy only because deSolve expects it to exist.}

\item{State}{Vector of current states. The elements of this vector must be
named because within this function's definition is
\code{with(as.list(State,Pars), {XXX} )} and code in XXX presupposes that it
can call named elements as variables with those names.}

\item{Pars}{Vector of parameter values with \emph{named} (see above)
elements.}
}
\value{
A list of length 2 (as expected by deSolve) where the first list
element is the vector of derivatives, i.e. the right hand side of the ODEs 
and the second element of the list is a vector of auxiliary
variables that one may wish to track over time.
}
\description{
This function returns the right hand side of an ordinary differential
equation model of G-CSF published by M. Scholz et al. in 2012 
(in Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling). Subcutaneous injections are not modeled.
The intended use of this function is as an argument to \code{ode()} of the \code{deSolve} package.
}
\details{
The model is depicted below  
\if{html}{\figure{scholz.png}} \if{latex}{\figure{scholz.png}{options: width=5in}}

Here S = stem cells, CG = colony forming units of granulocytes
and macrophages, PGB = proliferating granulopoietic blasts, 
MGB = maturing granulopoietic blasts
The system is regulated by G-CSF.
